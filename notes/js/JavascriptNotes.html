			<h2>What is a Variable</h2>
				<p>
					You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container. Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Variables are declared with the var keyword as follows:
				</p>
				<p>
					var foo = 3;
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, if you were to call the variable you created called foo, <br> 3 would be returned.
				</p>
			<h2>Functions</h2>
				<p>
					Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value.
				</p>
				<p>
					To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.
				</p>
				<p>
					function multiply(a, b) {<br> return a * b; <br>}
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, if you were to call multiply(5, 10) <br> It would return 50.
				</p>
			<h2>Passing Data Into Functions</h2>
				<p>
					As shown above with functions, you can pass data into a function to perform tasks for you.
				</p>
				<p>
					So, let's combine variables with functions like this:
				</p>
				<p>
					var this = 3; <br>
					var that = 6; <br>
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, let's call multiply that we created above and pass in our variables this and that:
				</p>
				<p>
					multiply(this, that) <br>
					This will return 18.
